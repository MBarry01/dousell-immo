# Claude Rules - Dousell Immo (ECC Engine)

## 🏗️ Technical Standards
- **Immutability**: ALWAYS use spread operators or immutable patterns.
- **Validation**: Use Zod for all system boundaries (API, Forms, DB).
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with user-friendly errors. No silent failures.
- **Logging**: No `console.log` in production. Use proper logging.

## 📦 File Organization
- MANY SMALL FILES > FEW LARGE FILES.
- Max 400 lines per file (800 lines absolute max).
- Organize by feature/domain.

## 🛠️ Commands
- `/plan`: Restate requirements and create a phased plan.
- `/tdd`: Implement with test-driven development.
- `/verify`: Run the full quality and verification loop.
- `/learn`: Extract patterns to `.claude/skills/learned/`.
- `/evolve`: Improve agent capabilities based on session experience.

## 🛡️ Security
- Principles of Least Privilege.
- Strict Supabase RLS checks.
- Audit sensitive operations (Leases, Payments).

## 📱 Mobile First
- All UI must be tested for mobile responsive (dvh, touch targets).
- Performance: Optimize bundle size and image loading.
